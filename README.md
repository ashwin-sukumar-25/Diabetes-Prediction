# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based Diabetes Prediction System developed using Python. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle and applies data preprocessing with Pandas, followed by training classification models using Scikit-learn. The model achieved an accuracy of 97% in predicting whether a person is diabetic based on medical attributes.
